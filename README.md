# Experimentation_A03
The first experiement I conducted was the use of Teachable Machine to make it easier for someone to learn the ASL alphabet by uploading the individual 
sign of each letters hand sign. I came across this idea when I had found out that my significant other knew a few signs and I though it would be a good 
idea to learn some of it as well and to also help her to learn a few new signs. The system works by using your webcam
I feel that this is a big step in the right direction to help better people tring to learn to sign.

My second experiment, using Runway I created 4 differnt AI generated images from a single fraze. I found it interesting how each image have some elements 
that are similar while most of the elemtants are different. For example the way the mountains are positioned and the stars/ships in the sky![3-artistic bright and colourful landscape of a mountain and the northern lights on mars with a few planets and plain flying in the sky](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122418286/227689234-66e5e419-149d-4595-a3da-351bb126cb81.png)

Lastly, the final experiement I conducted was with sound and body movement using ml5. I used this program to create a piano like program that uses your bodys
movement to change the keys that are played, while also allowing you to change the tone of the music played in the scoll down menu at the top of the page to 
the right of the start menu ![2023-03-24 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122418286/227689725-2374bb0c-0ccb-400d-a6f4-8a4f244fcfdc.png)
